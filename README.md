# React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial With Improvements

This is an extension of the [React tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

The following improvements have been implemented after the base tutorial:

* Display the location of each move in the move history list.
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* Generate the board with loops instead of hardcoding.
* Add a button that toggles the order of the moves list.
* Highlight the squares that won.
* Display a message for draws.

See branch ```original-tutorial``` for the game before improvements.
